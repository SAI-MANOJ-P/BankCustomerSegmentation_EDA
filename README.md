# BankCustomerSegmentation_EDA

## Introduction
This project combines Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with customer segmentation of a bank dataset. The initial phase involved EDA of customer data, followed by customer segmentation based on key attributes such as age, location, transaction history, frequency, and transaction amount. Profiles were created for each segment to better understand and serve the bank's customer base.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA, or Exploratory Data Analysis, is the process of examining a dataset to summarize its main characteristics, often with the help of visual methods. In this project, EDA is performed to uncover insights from the bank customer data.

## Data Used
The primary dataset used in this project is "bank_transactions.csv." You can find this dataset on Kaggle at [Kaggle Bank Transactions Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/bank-customer-segmentation).

## Files in the Repository
- **bank_transactions.csv**: This is the main dataset.
- **cleaned_data.csv**: It contains data after removing nulls, changing necessary data types, and adding an age group column.
- **transaction_data.csv**: Data grouped by customers, including transaction frequency, total amount, and month segmentation.
- **EDA_BankCustomerSegmentation.ipynb**: In this Jupyter Notebook, customer segmentation is done based on age and location attributes.
- **TransactionBehaviorSegmentation.ipynb**: This Jupyter Notebook includes detailed segmentation analysis, creating segments and customer profiles based on transaction behavior.

## Tools Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:**
  - **Pandas:** Used for data analysis and manipulation.
  - **Matplotlib:** Employed for data visualization.
